            <p>Life requires you to learn a trade and be responsible to live a good life. However, that does not mean you can't enjoy living. Don't be afraid to explore new things, seek opportunities. If one career fails, you have another one to fall back on. It's important to love what you do! Do your best and enjoy life ♥ There are so many job possibilities I never thougth I would enjoy working with computers, but I do!  </p>
