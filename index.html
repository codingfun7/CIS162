<p>My name is Ruth Ramirez, and I am a returning adult student to college. My college goal is to learn new concepts, ideas, and best practices in the computer science field. For fun I like to make flower and plant arrangements, especially giving them away to friends and family. I have been working in IT for some time now, and I enjoy learning about the different areas of IT.  My goal for this course is to expand my knowledge of web site design and planning. </p>
